# Sectcy (Section Efficiency)

**Sectcy** (Section Efficiency) is "The sleekest way to Select & Copy sections, with built-in note merging." It is a productivity plugin for Obsidian that helps you manage your note content with ease. It adds "Select" and "Copy" buttons to your section headers and allows you to merge folder notes.

## Features

- **Select and Copy Section**: Click the pointer icon to select the text of the entire section.
- **Copy Section**: Click the copy icon to copy the section text to your clipboard.
- **Configurable**:
    - **Always Show Icons**: Choose to always show the icons or only show them on hover.
    - **Include Header**: Choose whether to include the header title in the selection/copy.
    - **Toggle Buttons**: Independently enable or disable the Select and Copy buttons.
- **Merge Folder Notes**: Right-click a folder to merge all its markdown notes into a single file.

## Installation

### Manual Installation

1.  Download the latest release from the Releases page.
2.  Extract the `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` files to your vault's plugin folder: `<VaultFolder>/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-select-section/`.
